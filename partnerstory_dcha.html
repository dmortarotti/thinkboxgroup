In 2000, DCHA selected TBG as its energy partner to monitor and manage a $24M annual utility budget. In 2007 DCHA
self-implemented a $24M energy capital improvement program with TBG as owner’s rep and together will implement a phase-2
$104M program starting in 2017. The phase 2 includes the development of 1.4 MW of on-site solar generation; as well as, a 1.6MW combined heating and
cooling micro-turbine power system to be installed in the historic Langston Power Plant (1930) which is also being re-developed
as a community based asset to support STEAM education for DCHA residents.

  Elsie Whitlow Stokes Community Freedom PCS was able to overcome its energy challenges with the help of ThinkBox Group. The large
  challenges included an aging facility with a failing HVAC system a leaky roof, and an extremely limited capital budget.
  The project was a PACE-financed solar and efficiency retrofit and provides an important Washington D.C. school with timely and valuable upgrades to a
  facility that supports 350 pre-school and elementary school students. With ThinkBox's plan EWS was able to generate energy and water
  saving, mechanical upgrades, and a rooftop solar PV system. Overall, this project represents an innovative opportunity for many
  schools to immediately see cash flow positive results that can be used to improve the lives and education of their students.<br>


<br>

  Elsie Whitlow officials and ThinkBoxGroup, the school’s energy project developer, turned to the District Department of Energy and
  Environment’s PACE program for a financing solution. Through PACE, the school received 100% of the up front project capital that it
  will repay at a fixed rate over a 20-year term. Amortizing the payments over this term allows the solar and efficiency savings to offset
  and exceed the annual PACE payments. The capital for the project was provided by GreenworksLending, a Connecticut-based PACE lender.
  As an incentive to help offset the expense of hiring local community based contractors and solar installers, the project received $198,000
  from the D.C. Sustainable Energy Utility.

      <p>“Working with ThinkBox was a delight! They were immediately able to assess the complexities of our energy situation.
        ThinkBox was able to professionally create a plan to reduce our energy expenditures. Through a combination of solar
        installations and retrofits, we were able to save over $10,000 a year.

    <p>
In May of 1997, the US Department of Energy's Rebuilding America Program worked with the US Army Core of Egineers
 and with ThinkBox Group to save costs for the District of Columbia's Public School System. ThinkBox Group worked to this end and
 produced a 5 year comprehensive system-wide Energy Master Plan, resolved a dual fuel (interruptible vs. firm gas pricing) debate,
 established utility accounting system, and created a updated system-wide energy master plan. <br><br>

 This process required researching organizational objectives, market conditions, and statutory requirements; as well
  auditing and developing a ground source heat pump application feasibility study. ThinkBox also conducted Life Cycle Cost
  Assessment and decision support for fuel oil/natural gas
  fuel procurement and pricing strategy.

  <br><br>

  The successful project resulted in a $8 M cost avoidance in underground storage tank replacement as a result of the
  aforementioned study, exposed over $500,000 in erroneous utility billings to DCPS, and provided ECM procurement support materials still
  in use today.

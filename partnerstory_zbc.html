      The $1.6M ZBC sustainable infrastructure project enhances the energy efficiency, water efficiency, reliability and thermal
      comfort performance of the sixty-year old Zion Baptist Church while dramatically reducing maintenance requirements.
<br><br>
Project scope includes the replacement of: a broken chiller system, an oversized hot water boiler and domestic hot water system;
complete LED relighting, new windows and antiquated stormwater and sewage pumps.
<br><br>
Their new system includes a fully integrated, user-friendly operations technology platform which will allow maintenance staff to
control and monitor the performance of the energy systems remotely. A 50 kW solar system provides free power to the Church while also
recharging the sump pump 72-hour battery  back-up system which will prevent boiler room flooding during power outages.
<br><br>
Greenworks Lending through the DC-PACE program provided $1.2M in construction funding. ThinkBox developed the project
so that the annual savings covered the annual PACE assessment, allowing Zion Baptist Church to maximize the available capital
from savings. As a result of the program, the Zion Baptist Church appraised value of their property increased by over 20%.

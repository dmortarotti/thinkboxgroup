      First constructed in 1920 as a safe gathering place for
      migrant African-American women, the four story facility currently provides 84
      affordable rental units to the area’s low-income and vulnerable women.
<br><br>
      The Phyllis Wheatley Young Women’s Christian
    Association (YWCA) redevelopment project ensures the
    long-term preservation of 84 units of affordable housing
    in a gentrifying neighborhood of Washington, D.C. PACE financed solar and energy efficiency upgrades take the
    renovated facility beyond basic building code, reducing
    operating costs for the facility by nearly $6,000 per year.
    This project marks the first use of PACE financing for a
    U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
    (HUD) assisted mixed-finance public housing property. <br><br>
    The annual value of electric and water utility savings realized
    by the project, lowering energy use by 24% and water use 47%, is estimated to
    exceed $73,000. Nearly $6,000 of the annual savings will accrue to the
    property owner, with the remainder for debt service on the project. The
    project will also avoid annual emissions of 114 metric tons of CO2
    . More than $700,000 of funding provided by Amalgamated
Bank and secured through the DC PACE program will allow the addition of a 30
kW solar PV array and other energy and water conservation equipment. PACE
allows these permanent improvements to be added off balance sheet.<br><br>
    Over many engagements with offices within HUD, the
    DC Housing Authority, the Department of Human
    Services, and The Department of Housing and
    Community Development, Urban Ingenuity helped
    develop intercreditor agreements that ensure the
    property remains affordable housing for at least 40
    years while maintaining compatibility with PACE
    security structures. Noting the novelty of this Low
    Income Housing Tax Credit project, the Director of the
    District’s Department of Energy and Environment said
    “This project is a model for the nation.”

      <p>“Paul and Daron brought their knowledge and skills to support Dante’s Partners in providing affordable housing for
        over 80 underserved women in Washington DC. In total we have realized energy and operations savings above projections
        to date and are on track to generate over $650K during the next several years. By working diligently with them team,
        we were able to unlock significant capital from our energy, water and infrastructure systems to close the funding gap, including:
        solar Power; high efficiency heating and air conditioning; LED Lighting; and, a smart controls system that further
        lowers our operating costs.
        <br><br>
        Most of all it was fun to work with ThinkBox. With their on-going support Dantes Partners will continue to be a
        pioneer in Sustainable Infrastructure for years to come."
